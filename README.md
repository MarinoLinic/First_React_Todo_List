# How to start the application
To run this app, open a terminal in the main folder and type the following three commands:

Install dependencies,
```
$ npm i
```

and then run the program locally:
```
$ npm run start
```

## Personal notes
Some of the concepts I need to grasp much better are the hooks I used (useEffect, useRef, and useState) as well as using local storage. Plus my mental map of the code is still slightly hazy.
