# How to start the application
To run this app, open a terminal in the main folder and type the following two commands:

**Warning:** This command shouldn't be necessary but I had a building error without it.
```
$ npm install react-scripts --save
```

Build it,
```
$ npm run build
```

and then deploy it:
```
$ npm run start
```

## Personal notes
Some of the concepts I need to grasp much better are the hooks I used (useEffect, useRef, and useState) as well as using local storage. Plus my mental map of the code is still slightly hazy.
